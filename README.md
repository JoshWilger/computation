# Project Info

A short graphic adventure game created for the [2022 32bit game jam](https://itch.io/jam/32bit-jam-2022/rate/1772461).
As a solo project made in two weeks, the focus of the game was creating a unique experience with the environment and basic functionalities of an operating system. By using primarily drag and drop, text input, and point and click, the player learns through interaction and takes part in a narrative involving the rescue of two digital characters.
